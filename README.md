This website will be my personal site. It will have an about me section, then other sections that goes into what I've been learning. Like data structures, algorithms, and other concepts. There will also be a page for my projects that I want to show off. Each project will have its own subsection. 

## Timeline / Gameplan
- Planning Phase **We are here**
  - Currently I'm finalizing what the site will actually be over (as mentioned above) and the overall design / layout of each page. As well as what I'll host the site on (possibly here, but may be on AWS)
  - Design / Prototype
    - As mentioned, I'm finalizing the overall design for the site - IE color scheme, layout, etc. by creating a prototype using Figma *link to prototype will be pasted here once done*
  - **Plan to be done with this phase by end of June / Early July if time permits**
- Coding
  - Main languages: HTML5, JavaScript (react may be brought in as I want to learn it), CSS (bootstrap), May incorporate Node.js - undetermined as of now
  - **Want to start this phase by May as current job and moving is taking up most of my time**
- Deployment
  - I plan to deploy the site as soon as the first main pages are done. Will either be hosted on git or on AWS - links will be added here once that is decided
